The Symfony SDK offers integrations that support distributed tracing, including database queries, Twig template rendering, and cache pools. These integrations are enabled by default.

To use them, you need to use the latest version of the SDK. If the vendors (DBAL, Cache, and Twig) are installed, `enabled` will be set to `true`, so it's likely that this configuration is the same in your app.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: true
    cache:
      enabled: true
    twig: # templating engine
      enabled: true
```

You can adjust the integrations to your needs if you want to disable a specific integrations.

### Dbal

This integration supports tracking database queries as Spans. Enabling this option will create Spans for your queries.

It is enabled by default. To disable tracking database queries, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: true
```

### Twig

This integration adds distributed tracing for Twig template rendering using Sentry.

It is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    twig: # templating engine
      enabled: true
```

### Cache

This integration adds support for distributed tracing of cache pools.

It is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    cache: # cache pools
      enabled: true
```
